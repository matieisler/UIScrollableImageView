# UIScrollableImageView

The UIScrollableImageView class provides a lightweight, simple UIImageView wrapper that allows users to click on the image to zoom on it and scroll it.

To use it, simply import the UIScrollableImageView.swift file into your project, and use like if it were a regular UIImageView.
